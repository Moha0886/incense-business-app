## 📱 **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Install Xcode**

### **Step 1: Install Xcode (Required)**
1. **Open Mac App Store**
2. **Search "Xcode"** 
3. **Click "Get"** (Free, ~15GB download)
4. **Wait for installation** (30-60 minutes)

### **Step 2: After Xcode Installs**
Run these commands (I'll help you):
```bash
# Set Xcode as active developer directory
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

# Sync your iOS project (will work now!)
npm run ios:build

# Open in Xcode
npm run ios:open
```

## 📱 **ALTERNATIVE: Use PWA Right Now!**

While Xcode downloads, **your app is already working as a mobile app**:

## 🎯 **What Happens After Xcode Installs:**

### **1. I'll Run the Build Commands**

npm run ios:build    # ← Will work perfectly
npm run ios:open     # ← Opens Xcode with your app
```

### **2. In Xcode:**
- **Connect iPhone via USB**
- **Select your iPhone as target**
- **Click "Run" button (▶️)**
- **Your app installs on iPhone!**

### **3. For App Store:**

**Would you like to:**
1. **Try the PWA now** while Xcode downloads?
